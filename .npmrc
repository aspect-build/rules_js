# The rules_js linker won't see this public-hoist-pattern[] since hoisting is _not_ encoded
# in the pnpm lockfile. In pnpm it is a linking time consideration when laying out the node_modules
# tree. In rules_js we currently have a `public_hoist_packages` attribute on `npm_translate_lock`
# the emulates this behavior (see example in WORKSPACE). In the future we'll add support to
# parse the .npmrc file so these directives are used to direct hoisting in the rules_js linker as well.
