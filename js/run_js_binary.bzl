    """Wrapper around @aspect_bazel_lib run_binary that adds convienence attributes for using a js_binary tool.

    This rule does not require Bash `native.genrule`.

    Args:
        name: Target name
        tool: The tool to run in the action.

            Should be a js_binary rule. Use Aspect bazel-lib's run_binary
            (https://github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/blob/main/lib/run_binary.bzl)
            for other *_binary rule types.

        env: Environment variables of the action.

            Subject to `$(location)` and make variable expansion.

        srcs: Additional inputs of the action.

            These labels are available for `$(location)` expansion in `args` and `env`.

        output_dir: Set to True if you want the output to be a directory.

            Exactly one of `outs`, `output_dir` may be used.
            If you output a directory, there can only be one output, which will be a
            directory named the same as the target.

        outs: Output files generated by the action.

            These labels are available for `$(location)` expansion in `args` and `env`.

        args: Command line arguments of the binary.

            Subject to `$(location)` and make variable expansion.

        chdir: Working directory to run the binary or test in, relative to the workspace.

            By default, Bazel always runs in the workspace root.

            To run in the directory containing the run_js_binary under the source tree, use
            `chdir = package_name()` (or if you're in a macro, use `native.package_name()`).

            To run in the output directory where the run_js_binary writes outputs, use
            `chdir = "$(RULEDIR)"`

            WARNING: this will affect other paths passed to the program, either as arguments or in configuration files,
            which are workspace-relative.

            You may need `../../` segments to re-relativize such paths to the new working directory.

        stderr: set to capture the stderr of the binary to a file, which can later be used as an input to another target
                subject to the same semantics as `outs`

        stdout: set to capture the stdout of the binary to a file, which can later be used as an input to another target
                subject to the same semantics as `outs`

        exit_code_out: set to capture the exit code of the binary to a file, which can later be used as an input to another target
                subject to the same semantics as `outs`. Note that setting this will force the binary to exit 0.
                If the binary creates outputs and these are declared, they must still be created

        silent_on_success: produce no output on stdout nor stderr when program exits with status code 0.
                This makes node binaries match the expected bazel paradigm.

        copy_srcs_to_bin: When True, all srcs files are copied to the output tree that are not already there.
