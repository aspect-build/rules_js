# In general, the rules in this repository assume that runfiles
# are enabled as we do not support no runfiles case.
#
# If you are developing on Windows, you must either run bazel
# with administrator priviledges or enable developer mode. If
# you do not you may hit this error on Windows:
#
#   Bazel needs to create symlinks to build the runfiles tree.
#   Creating symlinks on Windows requires one of the following:
#       1. Bazel is run with administrator privileges.
#       2. The system version is Windows 10 Creators Update (1703) or later
#          and developer mode is enabled.

# Turn off legacy external runfiles on all platforms except Windows.
# This prevents accidentally depending on this feature, which Bazel will remove.
# Skylib's diff_test implementation for Windows depends on legacy external
# runfiles so we cannot disable it fully. TODO: disable for all platforms and
# remove the platform-specific config once the following fix is released:
