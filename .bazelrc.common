# In general, the rules in this repository assume that runfiles
# are enabled as we do not support no runfiles case.
#
# If you are developing on Windows, you must either run bazel
# with administrator priviledges or enable developer mode. If
# you do not you may hit this error on Windows:
#
#   Bazel needs to create symlinks to build the runfiles tree.
#   Creating symlinks on Windows requires one of the following:
#       1. Bazel is run with administrator privileges.
#       2. The system version is Windows 10 Creators Update (1703) or later
#          and developer mode is enabled.

# Turn off legacy external runfiles
# This prevents accidentally depending on this feature, which Bazel will remove.

# Turn on --incompatible_strict_action_env which was on by default
# in Bazel 0.21.0 but turned off again in 0.22.0. Follow
# https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/7026 for more details.
# This flag is needed to so that postinstall scripts can be executed
# on the host.
# See https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/27514.
