description: How to migrate from rules_nodejs to rules_js
---

This document contains some of the lessons we've learned at Aspect from doing consulting work, migrating some large client repos from rules_nodejs to rules_js 1.x.

:::info
This guide was written when rules_js was at version 1.x. In August 2024, [rules_js 2.0 was
released](https://blog.aspect.build/rulesjs-2) which had a few breaking changing including dropping support for Bazel 5 and requiring a minimum of rules_nodejs 6.1.0 and aspect_bazel_lib 2.7.1.

We may update this guide in the future with instructions for migrating directly from rules_nodejs to rules_js 2.0. In the meantime, the documented path is to upgrade from rules_nodejs -> rules_js 1.x as described by this guide and then from rules_js 1.x to rules_jx 2.0 as described by the [rules_js 2.x migration guide](./05-rules_js_2_migration.md).
:::

## Upgrade to Bazel 5.1 or greater

We follow [Bazel's LTS policy](https://bazel.build/release/versioning).

`rules_js` 1.x and the related rules depend on APIs that were introduced in Bazel 5.0.

However we recommend 5.1 because it includes a [cache for MerkleTree computations](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/pull/13879), which makes our copy operations a lot faster.

## Upgrade to rules_nodejs 5.0 or greater

`rules_js` depends on `rules_nodejs`, the core module from https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_nodejs. We need at least version 5.0 of the core `rules_nodejs` module.

This does not require that you upgrade `build_bazel_rules_nodejs` to 5.x.
`build_bazel_rules_nodejs` can remain at 4.x or older and work along side `rules_nodejs` 5.x and `rules_js`. See the [rules_nodejs_to_rules_js_migration](https://github.com/aspect-build/bazel-examples/blob/main/rules_nodejs_to_rules_js_migration/WORKSPACE) example for how to configure
your WORKSPACE to build with both `rules_nodejs` and `rules_js` while migrating.

## Install pnpm (optional)

`rules_js` is based on the pnpm package manager.
Our implementation is self-contained, so it doesn't matter if Bazel users of your project install pnpm.
However it's typically useful to create or manipulate the lockfile, or to install packages for use outside of Bazel.

You can follow [the pnpm install docs](https://pnpm.io/installation).

Alternatively, you can skip the install. All commands in this guide will use `npx` to run the pnpm tool without any installation.

> If you want to use a hermetic, Bazel-managed pnpm and node rather than use whatever is on your machine or is installed by `npx`, see [the FAQ](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/blob/main/docs/faq.md#can-i-use-bazel-managed-pnpm).

## Translate your lockfile to pnpm format (optional)

`rules_js` uses the `pnpm` lockfile to declare dependency versions as well as a deterministic layout for the `node_modules` tree.

The `node_modules` tree laid out by `rules_js` should be bug-for-bug compatible with the `node_modules` tree that
pnpm lays out with [hoisting](https://pnpm.io/npmrc#hoist) disabled (`hoist=false` set in your `.npmrc`).

We recommend adding `hoist=false` to your `.npmrc` so that your `node_modules` tree outside of Bazel is similar to the
`node_modules` tree that `rules_js` creates:

```
echo "hoist=false" >> .npmrc
```

See `npm_translate_lock` documentation for more information on pnpm hoisting.

You can use the `npm_package_lock`/`yarn_lock` attributes of `npm_translate_lock` to keep using those package managers.
When you do, we automatically run `pnpm import` on that lockfile to create the pnpm-lock.yaml that rules_js requires.
This has the downside that hoisting behavior may result in different results when
developers use `npm` or `yarn` locally, while rules_js always uses pnpm.
It also requires passing the `package.json` file to `npm_translate_lock` which invalidates that rule
whenever the package.json changes in any way.
As a result, we suggest using this approach only during a migration, and eventually switch developers to pnpm.

If you're ready to switch your repo to pnpm, then you'll use the `pnpm_lock` attribute of `npm_translate_lock`. Create a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file in your project:

1. Most migrations should avoid changing two things at the same time,
   so we recommend taking care to keep all dependencies the same (including transitive).
   Run `npx pnpm import` to translate the existing file. See the [pnpm import docs](https://pnpm.io/cli/import)
2. If you don't care about keeping identical versions, or don't have a lockfile,
   you could just run `npx pnpm install --lockfile-only` which generates a new lockfile.

> To make those commands shorter, we rely on the `npx` binary already on your machine.
> However you could use the Bazel-managed node and pnpm instead, like so:
> `bazel run -- @pnpm//:pnpm install --dir $PWD --lockfile-only`

The new `pnpm-lock.yaml` file needs to be updated by engineers on the team as well,
so when you're ready to switch over to rules_js, you'll have to train them to run `pnpm`
rather than `npm` or `yarn` when changing dependency versions or adding new dependencies.

If needed, you might have both the pnpm lockfile and your legacy one checked into the repository during a migration window.
You'll have to avoid version skew between the two files during that time.

Please note that using the `yarn_lock` attributes of `npm_translate_lock` has caveat of not supporting the [`pnpm-workspace.yaml`](https://pnpm.io/pnpm-workspace_yaml) which is needed by
`pnpm` to declare workspaces. Therefore, if your project need this, the only option is to migrate to `pnpm` immediately and use solely the
`pnpm_lock` attribute of `npm_translate_lock`.

## Test whether pnpm is working

A few packages have bugs which rely on "hoisting" behavior in yarn or npm, where undeclared dependencies can be loaded because they happen to be installed in an ancestor folder under `node_modules`.

In many cases, updating your dependencies will fix issues since maintainers are constantly addressing pnpm bugs.

You can also check if the bug exists outside of Bazel by setting [`hoist=false`](https://pnpm.io/npmrc#hoist) in your `.npmrc`. This disables pnpm's default behavior of hoisting one version of every package to a `node_modules` folder at the root of the virtual store (`node_modules/.pnpm/node_modules`) so can resolve undeclared "phantom" dependencies. `rules_js` doesn't support phantom dependencies as this would break the ability to lazy fetch & lazy link only what is needed for the target being built. Setting [`hoist=false`](https://pnpm.io/npmrc#hoist) in your `.npmrc` outside of Bazel more closely resembles how dependency resolution works in `rules_js`. Dependency issues can often be reproduced outside of Bazel in this way.

Another pattern which may break is when a configuration file references an npm package, then a library reads that configuration and tries to require that package. For example, this [mocha json config file](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/blob/main/examples/macro/mocha_reporters.json) references the `mocha-junit-reporter` package, so mocha will try to load that package despite not having a declared dependency on it.

Useful pnpm resources for these patterns:

-   [pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmpackageextensions](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmpackageextensions)
-   [pnpm.io/faq#pnpm-does-not-work-with-your-project-here](https://pnpm.io/faq#pnpm-does-not-work-with-your-project-here)

In our mocha example, the solution is to declare the expected dependency in `package.json` using the `pnpm.packageExtensions` key as [shown in this example](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/blob/main/package.json).

Another approach is to just give up on pnpm's stricter visibility for npm modules, and hoist packages as needed.
pnpm has flags `public-hoist-pattern` and `shamefully-hoist` which can do this, however we don't support those flags in rules_js yet.
Instead we have the `public_hoist_packages` attribute of [npm_translate_lock](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/blob/main/docs/npm_translate_lock.md).
In the future we plan to read these settings from `.npmrc` like pnpm does; follow [this issue](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js/issues/239).

As long as you're able to run your build and test under pnpm, we expect the behavior of `rules_js` should match.

## Link the node modules

Typically you just add a `npm_link_all_packages(name = "node_modules")` call to the BUILD file next to each `package.json` file:

```starlark
load("@npm//:defs.bzl", "npm_link_all_packages")

npm_link_all_packages(name = "node_modules")
```

This macro will expand to a rule for each npm package, which creates part of the `bazel-bin/[path/to/package]/node_modules` tree.

## Update WORKSPACE

The `WORKSPACE` file contains Bazel module dependency fetching and installation.

Add install steps from a release of rules_js, along with related rulesets you plan to use.

## Account for change to working directory

`rules_js` spawns all Bazel actions in the bazel-bin folder.

-   If you use a `chdir.js` workaround for tools like react-scripts, you can just remove this.
-   If you use `$(location)`, `$(execpath)`, or `$(rootpath)` make variable expansions in an argument to a program, you may need to prefix with `../../../` to avoid duplicated `bazel-out/[arch]/bin` path segments.
-   If you spawn node programs, you'll need to pass the `BAZEL_BINDIR` environment variable.
    -   In a `genrule` add `BAZEL_BINDIR=$(BINDIR)`
    -   ctx.actions.run add `env = { "BAZEL_BINDIR": ctx.bin_dir.path}`

## Update usage of npm package generated rules

-   the load point is now a `bin` symbol from `package_json.bzl`
-   this now produces different rules, which are explicitly referenced from `bin`
-   to run as a tool under `bazel build` you use [package] which is a `js_run_binary`
    -   rename `data` to `srcs`
    -   rename `templated_args` to `args`
-   as a program under `bazel run` you need to add a `_binary` suffix, you get a `js_binary`
-   as a test under `bazel test` you get a `js_test`

Example, before:

```starlark
load("@npm//npm-check:index.bzl", "npm_check")

npm_check(
    name = "check",
    data = [
        "//third_party/npm:package.json",
    ],
    templated_args = [
        "--no-color",
        "--no-emoji",
        "--save-exact",
        "--skip-unused",
        "third_party/npm",
    ],
)
```

Example, after:

```starlark
load("@npm//:npm-check/package_json.bzl", "bin")

exports_files(["package.json"])

bin.npm_check(
    name = "check",
    srcs = [
        "//third_party/npm:package.json",
    ],
    args = [
        "--no-color",
        "--no-emoji",
        "--save-exact",
        "--skip-unused",
        "third_party/npm",
    ],
)
```

## Advanced Migration Use Cases

There are some cases where `pnpm` may not be a straight shot for users who have complex uses cases of `yarn` or `rules_nodejs`.
This may include use of `resolutions` or cases where targets can't migrate all at once and require a gradual migration.

### rules_nodejs shim

If you have a use case where you need to go project by project in your `WORKSPACE`, there is a way in which you can build your package with `rules_js` and expose it to `rules_nodejs` targets (and vice versa).
In your `WORKSPACE` file, add the following:

```starlark
    http_file(
        name = "rules_js_to_rules_nodejs_adapter",
        downloaded_file_path = "defs.bzl",
        sha256 = "fed5f963d02e913978a76a5fd9ecbd082c54dedbd3cbf12607bce6c91be989ff",
        urls = [
            "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspect-build/bazel-examples/1b8be767c587bc1187efa283af515f4c78e78b86/rules_nodejs_to_rules_js_migration/bazel/rules_js_to_rules_nodejs_adapter.bzl",
        ],
    )
```

Then can create a macro around `js_library` with the following definition:

```starlark
load("@aspect_rules_js//js:defs.bzl", "js_library")
load("@rules_js_to_rules_nodejs_adapter//file:defs.bzl", "rules_js_to_rules_nodejs_adapter")

js_library(
    name = "_%s" % name,
    srcs = srcs,
)

rules_js_to_rules_nodejs_adapter(
    name = "%s" % name,
    # pass this to the js_library underneath to support first party linking
    # in rules_nodejs under bazel
    package_name = package_name,
    visibility = visibility,
    deps = [
        ":_%s" % name,
    ],
)
```

This way, when you migrate a package, it will be exposed in a way that `rules_nodejs` will keep working. The trade off is that your new usage of `rules_js` will need to `_` reference the target. Alternatively, if you'd like the `rules_js` target to keep the name without the `_`, you can change it so that your adapter is prefixed with `legacy_` in the name, and update respective call sites.

## Completing the migration

Once everything is migrated, we can remove the legacy rules.

In `package.json` you can remove usage of the following npm packages which contain Bazel rules, as they don't work with `rules_js`.
Instead, look in [the Aspect repository](https://github.com/aspect-build/) for replacement rulesets.

-   `@bazel/typescript`
-   `@bazel/rollup`
-   `@bazel/esbuild`
-   `@bazel/create`
-   `@bazel/cypress`
-   `@bazel/concatjs`
-   `@bazel/jasmine`
-   `@bazel/karma`
-   `@bazel/terser`

Some `@bazel`-scoped packages are still fine, as they're tools or JS libraries rather than Bazel rules:

-   `@bazel/bazelisk`
-   `@bazel/buildozer`
-   `@bazel/buildifier`
-   `@bazel/ibazel` (watch mode)
-   `@bazel/runfiles`

In addition, rules_js and associated rulesets can manage dependencies for tools they run. For example, rules_esbuild downloads its own esbuild packages. So you can remove these tools from package.json if you intend to run them only under Bazel.

In `WORKSPACE` you can remove declaration of the following bazel modules:

-   `build_bazel_rules_nodejs`

You'll need to remove `build_bazel_rules_nodejs` load() statements from BUILD files as well.
We suggest using [the Aspect documentation](https://docs.aspect.build/) to locate replacements for the rules you use.
