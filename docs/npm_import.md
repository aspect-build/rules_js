Repository rules to fetch third-party npm packages

These use Bazel's downloader to fetch the packages.
You can use this to redirect all fetches through a store like Artifactory.

See <https://blog.aspect.dev/configuring-bazels-downloader> for more info about how it works
and how to configure it.

[`translate_pnpm_lock`](#translate_pnpm_lock) is the primary user-facing API.
It uses the lockfile format from [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/motivation) because it gives us reliable
semantics for how to dynamically lay out `node_modules` trees on disk in bazel-out.

To create `pnpm-lock.yaml`, consider using [`pnpm import`](https://pnpm.io/cli/import)
to preserve the versions pinned by your existing `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file.

If you don't have an existing lock file, you can run `npx pnpm install --lockfile-only`.

Advanced users may want to directly fetch a package from npm rather than start from a lockfile.
[`npm_import`](#npm_import) does this.

Repository rule to generate npm_import rules from pnpm lock file.

The pnpm lockfile format includes all the information needed to define npm_import rules,
including the integrity hash, as calculated by the package manager.

For more details see, https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/blob/main/packages/lockfile-types/src/index.ts.

Instead of manually declaring the `npm_imports`, this helper generates an external repository
containing a helper starlark module `repositories.bzl`, which supplies a loadable macro
`npm_repositories`. This macro creates an `npm_import` for each package.

The generated repository also contains BUILD files declaring targets for the packages
listed as `dependencies` or `devDependencies` in `package.json`, so you can declare
dependencies on those packages without having to repeat version information.

Bazel will only fetch the packages which are required for the requested targets to be analyzed.
Thus it is performant to convert a very large pnpm-lock.yaml file without concern for
users needing to fetch many unnecessary packages.

**Setup**

In `WORKSPACE`, call the repository rule pointing to your pnpm-lock.yaml file:

```starlark
load("@aspect_rules_js//js:npm_import.bzl", "translate_pnpm_lock")

# Read the pnpm-lock.yaml file to automate creation of remaining npm_import rules
translate_pnpm_lock(
    # Creates a new repository named "@npm_deps"
    name = "npm_deps",
    pnpm_lock = "//:pnpm-lock.yaml",
)
```

Next, there are two choices, either load from the generated repo or check in the generated file.
The tradeoffs are similar to
[this rules_python thread](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/issues/608).

1. Immediately load from the generated `repositories.bzl` file in `WORKSPACE`.
This is similar to the 
[`pip_parse`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_python/blob/main/docs/pip.md#pip_parse)
rule in rules_python for example.
It has the advantage of also creating aliases for simpler dependencies that don't require
spelling out the version of the packages.
However it causes Bazel to eagerly evaluate the `translate_pnpm_lock` rule for every build,
even if the user didn't ask for anything JavaScript-related.

```starlark
load("@npm_deps//:repositories.bzl", "npm_repositories")

npm_repositories()
```

In BUILD files, declare dependencies on the packages using the same external repository.

Following the same example, this might look like:

```starlark
js_test(
    name = "test_test",
    data = ["@npm_deps//@types/node"],
    entry_point = "test.js",
)
```

2. Check in the `repositories.bzl` file to version control, and load that instead.
This makes it easier to ship a ruleset that has its own npm dependencies, as users don't
have to install those dependencies. It also avoids eager-evaluation of `translate_pnpm_lock`
for builds that don't need it.
This is similar to the [`update-repos`](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle#update-repos)
approach from bazel-gazelle.

In a BUILD file, use a rule like
[write_source_files](https://github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/blob/main/docs/write_source_files.md)
to copy the generated file to the repo and test that it stays updated:

```starlark
write_source_files(
    name = "update_repos",
    files = {
        "repositories.bzl": "@npm_deps//:repositories.bzl",
    },
)
```

Then in `WORKSPACE`, load from that checked-in copy or instruct your users to do so.
In this case, the aliases are not created, so you get only the `npm_import` behavior
and must depend on packages with their versioned label like `@npm__types_node-15.12.2`.

Import a single npm package into Bazel.

Normally you'd want to use `translate_pnpm_lock` to import all your packages at once.
It generates `npm_import` rules.
You can create these manually if you want to have exact control.

Bazel will only fetch the given package from an external registry if the package is
required for the user-requested targets to be build/tested.

This is a repository rule, which should be called from your `WORKSPACE` file
or some `.bzl` file loaded from it. For example, with this code in `WORKSPACE`:

```starlark
npm_import(
    name = "npm__at_types_node_15.12.2",
    package = "@types/node",
    version = "15.12.2",
    integrity = "sha512-zjQ69G564OCIWIOHSXyQEEDpdpGl+G348RAKY0XXy9Z5kU9Vzv1GMNnkar/ZJ8dzXB3COzD9Mo9NtRZ4xfgUww==",
)
```

> This is similar to Bazel rules in other ecosystems named "_import" like
> `apple_bundle_import`, `scala_import`, `java_import`, and `py_import`.
> `go_repository` is also a model for this rule.

The name of this repository should contain the version number, so that multiple versions of the same
package don't collide.
(Note that the npm ecosystem always supports multiple versions of a library depending on where
it is required, unlike other languages like Go or Python.)

To consume the downloaded package in rules, it must be "linked" into the link package in the
package's `BUILD.bazel` file:

```
load("@npm__at_types_node__15.12.2__links//:link_js_package.bzl", link_types_node = "link_js_package")

link_types_node()
```

This instantiates a `link_js_package` target for this package that can be referenced by the alias
`@//link/package:npm__name` and `@//link/package:npm__@scope+name` for scoped packages.
The `npm` prefix of these alias is configurable via the `namespace` attribute.

When using `translate_pnpm_lock`, you can `link` all the npm dependencies in the lock file with:

```
load("@npm//:defs.bzl", "link_js_packages")

link_js_packages()
```

`translate_pnpm_lock` also creates convienence aliases in the external repository that reference
the `link_js_package` targets. For example, `@npm//name` and `@npm//@scope/name`.

To change the proxy URL we use to fetch, configure the Bazel downloader:

1. Make a file containing a rewrite rule like

    rewrite (registry.nodejs.org)/(.*) artifactory.build.internal.net/artifactory/$1/$2

1. To understand the rewrites, see [UrlRewriterConfig] in Bazel sources.

1. Point bazel to the config with a line in .bazelrc like
common --experimental_downloader_config=.bazel_downloader_config
