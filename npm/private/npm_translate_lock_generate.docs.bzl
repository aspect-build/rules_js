Build rules generated by `npm_translate_lock`
=============================================

These are loaded from the external repository created by `npm_translate_lock` based on the name provided.

For example, if you run `npm_translate_lock(name = "npm")` then these rules can be loaded with

```
load("@npm//:defs.bzl", "npm_link_targets", "npm_link_all_packages")
```

# NOTE: we don't attempt to run stardoc against @npm//:defs.bzl to produce these docstrings
# because that file load()s from BUILD files in every package, so the bzl_library target required
# is impossible to write.
# Instead, we define the interfaces in this file, while the implementations live in npm_translate_lock_generate.bzl.
