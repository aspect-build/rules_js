# FIXME: this isn't very usable yet due to the new "repository strict visibility" in bzlmod.
# You must list all repositories that you load() from or reference their targets,
# and ALSO any repositories that get brought into your repository scope via macro expansion.
# rules_js macros like npm_link_all_packages(name = "node_modules") will cause references to these repositories.
# We don't recommend bzlmod for rules_js users quite yet.
