# NB: commit hash here is temporary until Bazel 6.0.0rc3 or 6.0.0 final are out (which ever is next).
#     using last_green fails sometimes if the commit hash it resolves to doesn't yet have an bazel
#     artifact available for download
# The first line of this file is used by Bazelisk and Bazel to be sure
# the right version of Bazel is used to build and test this repo.
# This also defines which version is used on CI.
#
# Note that you should also run integration_tests against other Bazel
# versions you support.
